# Reactors / Python3 / SynbiohubAdapter

This is a Python3 Reactors base customized with SBH Adapter code. We may
end up deprecating this once we've exercised the SBH Adapter codebase and
understand how to best embed it in functions.

## How it works

Install an Ubuntu-tailored pySBOL wheel then layer in `master` from `nroehner/pySBOLx`, `SD2E/xplan_to_sbol`, and `SD2E/synbiohub_adapter`

## Automation

This repository should be rebuilt when any of its dependencies are updated.
